### [RookieRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/rookierank)
Calling out all first timers and those new to competitive programming. RookieRank invites all levels of programmers who have never participated in a rated algorithms competition before to experience the thrill! 

RookieRank begins Tuesday, July 26th, at 9am PDT. Rookies will have 48 hours (until July 28th at 9am PDT) to solve 5 algorithmic challenges. 

We will have two leaderboards. One for all first time competitve programmers. These are users who are not listed on the [Algorithms Leaderboard](https://www.hackerrank.com/leaderboard). 

We will have a separate leaderboard for all rated users. These are users who have participated in a rated algorithms contest before.
